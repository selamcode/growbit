## **Progress Track**

### Stage 1. getting you workspace ready for development 

- a simple design of my project - (ERD diagram)  [x]
- install `pyenv` to control python versions [x]
- install Install Django REST framework (DRF) for API [] 
- Setup git and `.env` [x]

### Stage 2. Start development (model)

- Build models using ERD [x]

## Stage 3. Start development (view)

- CRUD and App logic []
#### Simple Summary: How to Create a RESTful Service with DRF (django rest framework) I will be using this to make it restful. 

> Every DRF REST endpoint generally involves 4 steps:

- Model → Define the data you store in the database (models.py).

- Serializer → Define how to convert model data ↔ JSON, plus validation rules.

- View → Decide how to handle requests (list, create, update, delete).

- URL Routing → Connect the endpoint path to your view.
